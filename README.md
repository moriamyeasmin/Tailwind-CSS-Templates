## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is structured to keep all templates organized and easily accessible. Each template resides in its own folder under the `templates/` directory.


## 🛠️ How to Use a Template

To use any of the templates in your own project, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/Tailwind-CSS-Templates.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/Tailwind-CSS-Templates.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Template:**
    Go into the folder of the specific template you want to use (e.g., `plantic`).
    ```bash
    cd Tailwind-CSS-Templates/templates/plantic
    ```
3.  **Start Developing:**
    You can copy the entire template folder (`plantic` in this case) into your project structure.
4.  **Install Dependencies (If applicable):**
    If the template uses a specific Tailwind configuration or build process (e.g., PostCSS, PurgeCSS), check for a `package.json` file inside the template folder and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run build # or whatever build command is specified
    ```
    *Note: The core structure is designed for simplicity, often requiring just the HTML/CSS files.*
